When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

. I would create a remote repository when other developers are working on the project and as a way to back up my project 
- in case my computer crashes.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

. If git automatically updated my repository, the new code might break what I am working.
. I could be working on a branch of old software that a special customer needs repaired.
