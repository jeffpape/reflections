When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

. I would create a remote repository when other developers are working on the project and as a way to back up my project 
- in case my computer crashes.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

. If git automatically updated my repository, the new code might break what I am working.
. I could be working on a branch of old software that a special customer needs repaired.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

. A clone is a copy of a repository.
. A branch is new off shoot development done in the same repository. The branch separates for the main line, master. Emperically, developers will more likely merge a branch into master.
. A fork is a new repository, typically stored on GitHub.com. Software developers often modify the code on their forks; they may or may not submit their code back to the parent fork. The parent fork may or may not accept, the modifications.

This is a local change.
